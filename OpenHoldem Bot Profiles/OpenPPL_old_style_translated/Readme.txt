
Many of these profiles got posted by members who quit botting;
others are reposts from the old forum, so we often do#t know
exactly who posted the profile.
We

Are thes profiles "winning"?
==========================
Probably not, because:
* most of the profile creators quit botting
* OpenPPL might behave slightly different than Shanky-PPL
* the games did change
* some profiles are "incomplete", dependind on a default-bot.
So these are DEMO-BOTS as a starting-point, no guarantee for anything.


We did of course not include:
=============================
* any profiles for sale
* any profiles by Egor, as we believe, they are part of his paid software
* any profiles by moderators of the bonusbots forum (Zulu and Webber)


LICENSE:
========
All these profiles got released "for free use", 
to our best knowledge without any explicit license
and most profile-creators disappeared or are unknown.
As we distribute them as part of OpenPPL
we believe it is best to release them under GPL v3.
