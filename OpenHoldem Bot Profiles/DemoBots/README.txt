INTRODUCTION
============
This is a collection of poker bots, which have been published 
on the OpenHoldem and WinHoldem-forums.
Their purpose is to give you a starting-point
to develop your own bots.
They probably won't win (any longer) and maybe even don't work as expected.
So don't waste your money on the real-money-tables.

FURTHER INFO
============
If you are looking for more info, some help 
and the opportunity to contribute,
please visit our forums. You are welcome.

DLL- and Perl-bots
==================
OpenHoldem provides the opportunity to code a bot
in C(++) or Perl, though that topic is considered to be a bit "advanced".
You will find some really good demo-bots in the C++ and Perl-section of the forum.
Just register and say hello.

LICENSE
=======
This is a collection of poker bots, which have been published 
on the OpenHoldem and WinHoldem-forums
(www.maxinmontreal.com and www.winholdem.net).
They have been released to the public without any explicit copyright;
they were meant for public (but probably non-commercial) use.
As most of their creators have left the botting-world, we assume, 
it is most suitable to release this collection as study material
under GPL v3, just as the OpenHoldem botting framework.

We have included a copy of the GPL v3 in this package;
