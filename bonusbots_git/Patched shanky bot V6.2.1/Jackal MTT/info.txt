JackalSNGMTT Profile 

Best tournament for this profile is the $1.10 90 man sngmtt that has a double stack and pays out top 18. This is the tournament that I grinded out over 700 of to build up my BR. They are safe, slow, and have a good ROI. Other than that this works well with the 45, 27, and 18 man sngs. Another nice sngmtt to play is the $2.25 180 man sng. This is a single stack tourney so variance can keep you out of the money in them for a while so be careful, but it still does well in them.
