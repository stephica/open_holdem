// Loose aggressive tournament no-limit holdem profile

// Version 1.1
//   1.0 Initial version
//   1.1 Forgot 'havetrips' in the postflop code, added it
//   1.2 smartened up the play a little
//
// Playstyle rules:
// Preflop:
//   Raise when nobody else has raised
//   Call any raise up to 5bb
//   Fold to unreasonably large raises (>5bb)
//   When shortstacked, push or fold
// Postflop:
//   Bet when nobody else has bet
//   Call a bet with any pair or draw
//   Fold only when someone else bets or raises and we have nothing
