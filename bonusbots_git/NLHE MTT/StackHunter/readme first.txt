NOTE

This profile has been tested and will work better unassisted in its play.
please remember that in tournament poker you will lose more games than you win however the solid play
of Stackhunter should make back losses plus profit over time. 
please stick to a good bankroll management strategy as this is key to the profit long term.
in tournaments you should never buy in to any game with less than 40 buy ins in your bankroll
IE if you intend to play $1 sitngo's you would need a bankroll of at least $40 

This strategy and advice will keep you out of trouble when downswings happen. and they will.
