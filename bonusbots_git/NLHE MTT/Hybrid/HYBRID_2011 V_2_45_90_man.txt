//  REVISITED BY BOOM 30th JAN 2011 v 1 
//  Added new post flop code, and  a little stack protection early on, also changed isfinaltable as that works only fulltilt and re arranged a few
//  code blocks to ensure they were in correct order, minor fixes but fixes non the less !!!!!!!

// BIGSTACK PROTECTION BASED ON OPPONENTS STACKSIZES AT TABLE
