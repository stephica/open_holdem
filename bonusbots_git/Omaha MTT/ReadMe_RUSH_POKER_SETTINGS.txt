In rush poker,  there is a quick fold option.  To utilize this option, the bot needs to be able to fold in turn.

The 6max profile availaible has this option turned off.  If you open the notepad file and look at line 22 you will see:

EnableFoldInTurn = oFF




If you are playing rush poker and want to see as many hands as possible during your session, you may want to turn this option on.  

Simply change line 22 to say:

EnableFoldInTurn = oN



If you make the change be sure to save the file before you load it.
